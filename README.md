## New York City Hot Spots (MERN Stack)

###### A website to show the most popular places in NYC right now. 



It pulls in live data from Google Places, taking a snapshot of the 
busiest places, and the hot score is weighted from the total reviews from Yelp 
and Google. 

The site also features a map component, in which I overlaid the
hottest spots in NYC for restaurants, bars, and pubs. Users can see how
 the popularity of places evolves over the night, especially as places start 
 closing down and the activity concentrates in the downtown area. Users can also
  select the neighborhood they want, the day and time, and are able to see the
   hottest places, check out images, and save it to their list. 
   
In the future, I am planning to add a trip planning feature, where if someone
 were to visit NYC, he or she can save the list of hottest places and the
  site autogenerates a plan for the evening.
