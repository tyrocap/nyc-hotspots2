The food came out promptly, was hot, and tasted good.  The scallion pancakes we're on point. The lu rou fan was interesting with the sunny side up eggs but the sauce was too sweet and clashed with the savory side of the dish.  Overall, it was decent Taiwanese food but don't go there expecting Flushing Taiwanese food standards or prices either...my check was $22.00 for these two dishes.",

That being said, Win Son serves amazing tasting Taiwanese fusion food that takes classic Taiwanese dishes and adds a modern spin. The Lu-rou fan was amazing with the egg cooked perfectly, and the Taiwanese fried chicken and waffles are to die for. \n\nDefinitely try to come as early as possible as there's usually a line at prime hours.",

I was having lunch alone and she walked up to me and asked me to leave because she was waiting to seat another customer... I counted and there were more than 20 empty seats in the restaurant, which I pointed out. I am always vigilant to not overstay in a crowded place, and this was far from being the case. She said it was a busy time: it was actually 2:20pm, the very end of the lunch service. As I was dining alone, I had eaten much faster than the tables seated left and right, I just wanted to finish 2 pages of my book chapter. As I got up to leave reluctantly, her colleague sat the \"waiting customer\" at one of the many free tables, with no problem. She didn't apologize. I used to come here often enough but I will think twice now, her rudeness ruined my lunch break.",

Downside was the rolls we got - they were bland and felt like we were only eating the wrapping. The dumplings were on point and if you can, choose everything with ginger in the description!! So good!! Of course the pork buns are mandatory, so get them!\nWe waited 40 minutes, but the cool part is that they send a text when it's almost your turn, so you don't have to cram into the entryway.",

The waffle was crispy and chicken was barely warm and it seemed like it was sitting in the kitchen for a while. They forgot the maple syrup and we had to ask for it. I didn't bother telling the waiter about the chicken being damp and cold since I didn't want yo wait another half hr for the food to come back to the table. The eggs Benedict was good but again, it was barely warm.\n\nWe got the flourless chocolate cake which was really nice but the sad part was that when it came to the table it seemed that the ice cream had melted on the plate (check out the picture attached). It was a nice desert but when you know that it was just sitting in the kitchen for a while it kills it for you.\n \nIt is a nice brunch place but don't expect much from the service.",

Then when my friends and I questioned the person who grabbed and twisted my arm, the management staff in question screamed in our faces and told me I had imagined it and that I deserved it anyway. Further, one of our friends was told he had to pay 40 dollars to come in. The rest of our friend group wasn’t asked to pay anything. He was dressed the same as we were in terms of fulfilling the dress code. When he said he couldn’t afford it, he was turned away. He was the only minority. Take that as you will. This bar ruined my night and left me feeling awful, but I hope this review helps you make the decision to go somewhere, anywhere else.",

Somehow they've squeezed a few pages of non-sugary foods like appetizers and entrees into their thick, spiral menus and offer fun foods to add to the dreamy dining experience to make you realize it wasn't just one big sugar high; instead it's the great service, the friendly wait-staff and birthday celebrations at almost every table throughout the evening with a ruckus and a birthday candle that's got some kick to it.  Fun, worth the trip from NJ for my daughter's birthday and recommended to walk off the meal at the nearby High Line.",

I had to speak to the manager to get us seated which happened in the next 10 minutes or so. It took about 30 minutes for us to get our waters after we were seated. The food took another hour and only a potion of our dessert orders came out. We ended up canceling the remaining desserts. I walked up to the kiosk to settle my check and leave.

The food was fairly average (and had some issues along the way), but all in all I had an excellent experience.\n\nFirst, weather permitting, one has a choice between eating outside or inside.  As it was cool outside, the bar and dining area was covered by a tent, and the sound was loud to say the least.  Inside the building, as perhaps befitting a restaurant at a church, it was almost silence.  Also, there is a soaring ceiling.  The atmosphere is not elegant, but a solemn refinement.  \n\nThe rolls to start out the meal were soft, tasty and slightly warm. \n\nFor the main courses, we had the good short ribs (which could have used some more sauce), some good crab cakes, and a fairly good, but not extraordinary burger.  I prefer my burger without any extra sauces, but just fried onions.  They nicely were able to accommodate me. I specifically asked for a plain burger with onions and without cheese. Well it came with cheese. Sent it back and it came medium when I wanted it rare to medium rare.  Sent it back again and it was medium rare in parts and medium in others. On the other hand the french fries were fabulous.  They were very moist and with skins.  The way I like them. Delicious.   Anyway, they were very nice and did not charge us for the burger.  Not only that but they brought us all a lovely dessert wine with our dessert.  That is superb service!  Not only that they were so friendly and apologetic.  \n\nFor dessert I wanted the cheesecake, but they were out of it.  I had to \"settle\" for the Italian cookie plate, which was actually very good.  \n\nAll in all, a great evening and I look forward to going back (although will have to think twice about the burger. Note, they also have an Impossible Burger, which I might try if I had a friend to split the regular and the Impossible with and who wanted both rare to medium rare with just onions.",

It was a great way to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner. The portions were overly generous, so we ended up with many leftovers for the next day (or more if we had wished). They were also playing Christmas music, so my kids' hearts filled with holiday joy when we walked into the dining room. My kiddos also liked having mocktails with dinner.\n\nIn addition to a great Thanksgiving meal, Inside Park at St. Bart's has an expansive wine list. My wife and I had a Chinon with dinner that was excellent!\n\nI would definitely try Inside Park at St. Bart's for Thanksgiving again. I would also go back to try dining outside when the weather is warmer. No matter what, it seems like Inside Park at St. Bart's is a great place to dine/ enjoy drinks anytime of year.",

Better than any pizza literally anywhere in the US or any other country for that matter. I'm not sure how they do it. And I've been to dozens of pizza places in NYC including all the legends. It's just amazing. The decor is really nice. The cocktails are good. Service is solid. Gratuity is included. Prices are fine. My wife, my two friends and I were totally knocked out. Well done.",

There was an hour wait, but they were very accommodating especially with our 5 year old son with us. So lets get to the food!! We ordered the margherita with onions & the square pizza minus the olives, added the onions. So i like the sour dough crust. It is light airy & doesn't feel so heavy. But it can be a lot for people that are not fans of sour dough. The sauce was just ok for me. I've had much better tasting sauce. Cheese was fresh & in good amount. I liked the crust on the square pizza more. It was nice & crispy on the edges. But I dont think it's worth almost double the price of the margherita. Drinks are good. The tip included in the prices is definitely  a nice addition. The service was great btw. The decor is nice & chill & not overly hipsterish (sorry BK I represent Queens!!). Overall good experience. I would definitely recommend people to go there if they are into sour dough.",

It was crowded when I was there and the staff was efficient and friendly. There is a lot to see in a small space. \n\nThere was nowhere to eat inside as it’s for take out so we walked to Whole Foods to eat our bagel sandwiches upstairs. Unfortunately I didn’t love the smoked salmon but was glad there is still a thriving NY Jewish deli.\n\nThe order my parents received via Fedex was received in excellent condition, arrived the day it was supposed to and was packed well. They loved the whitefish salad but it was very salty. Same with the smoked salmon but even more salty which I didn’t think was possible. Personally I don’t think it should be that salty as it ruins the flavor and is overwhelming. I prefer smoked salmon to be more buttery, mild and not as hard. I prefer my whitefish to not taste like a salt shaker. Just way too much sodium to enjoy. \n\nThe chopped liver was good and similar to the one I make at home with a hard boiled egg as it was more natural tasting with less salt than the whitefish and lox. \n\nMy parents liked the bagels that were delivered.",

Unfortunately it was the same feeling I had before: somewhat disappointed but somewhat content that it’s just good food. \n\nFood: it’s more chinese and pan asian than Vietnamese. In traditional Vietnam, we don’t eat things like green curry, that’s Thai, nor the thick story fry with fried tofu, that’s chinese. \n\nService: great service! They’re lovely people who were kind, patient, friendly. They stayed open for us to finish the dinner. \n\nAtmosphere: it’s an old place that’s been in NYC over a decade. Inside it’s very “asian” and “tropical” themed. It’s casual, fun, colorful. Some of it is very western too. \n\nI wouldn’t make this a favorite not anywhere on my list. It’s just a restaurant that will blend in with all of grand street.",

At first, I was about to order another selection from the menu, but our waiter told us the Matodor combo is enough food for two. She was definately telling the truth. It was more than enough for two, and the price was very reasonable. All the food was AMAZING! The Sangria was okay. I think it would taste better with a mix of fruit in it. Google gave me directions to the location closest to me. Pio Pio 3 is very small inside; a bit tight. Very intimate I would say. Since they have 9 locations in all, I would prefer to try another location that is not so tight. Overall, I had no complaints. I enjoyed myself, and the food was AMAZING!",

The employees were all super courteous and attentive!\n\nNothing beats having breakfast for lunch, especially the value that comes with it, got the \"2x2x2\" usually any breakfast combo comes with unlimited pancakes, so I topped up my pancakes about 4 times, you'd expect to be paying atleast like $15 - $20 for breakfast anywhere, but that wasn't the case at all! My total ended up being 5.43 before tip! This made my visit not only shocking but so worth it! I'm definitely coming here again.",

Our server approached our table with one question that stood out to us during our entire dinner experience where are you guys from? From here, NYC, we told him but now we question if that response made our entire dinner experience the way it was. Our order was taken and was out within a few minutes except for my son's order. So we then tried to catch the servers attention but he did not  have any eye contact with us at all we had to wave him down for him to come to our table.  He then went  back and forth telling us we never placed my son's order to begin with showing me his notepad. As a server the customer is always right. Do not go back and forth just admit that someone was wrong and the right thing to do is get the order out as quickly as possible.  Our water at the table was never refilled as we had to ask the server himself for more water, something we should not have to do it should already be done. Overall experience one star.",

A half hour before our reservation I got a text message that says BYOB, we do not serve alcohol. It is false advertisement to say the least. I called them and they said they moved and they don’t have a liquor license. The only thing he could say was I’m sorry. They definitely need to update their website, so disappointed",

We also ordered Paneer Tikka, which was served on a sizzling skillet and tasted delicious. The Phaal Curry lives up to its hype! While at the restaurant, we did watch someone successfully complete the challenge. We were not masochistic enough to force ourselves through the misery of the challenge. I made it through about a third of the dish, with the help of a fair amount of raita, naan, and rice. This may mute the pain in your mouth, but be warned that there is nothing that will tame the burn as the curry reaches your digestive tract. I was feeling a strong gag reflex coming on as I reached the limits of my endurance. I suffered enough overnight that I’m glad I stopped when I did.",

City Vineyard is definitely part of this but \n\nCity Vineyard is situated on Pier 26 which was convenient as it was next to the Downtown Boathouse Club which sponsors free kayaking in the summer / fall. \n\nDrinks were on the menu this evening; the variety is similar to any other bar. The Strawberry Forever and Mango Spritz started the evening. Although super popular, the mango drink was OK. I definitely favored the fruity strawberry drink. The Long Cool Flower was also bitter and not as satiating but fortunately the Band on the Rum was delicious. \n\nRooftop access begins at 400 and offers beautiful views of the Hudson and a towering view of One World Trade. The upstairs bar only offers wines and beers. It gets packed as the evening progresses.\n\nTip: No Happy Hour and drinks range from 10 to 20 bucks. If you're looking for an inexpensive experience you need to head somewhere else.",

I usually get the cowgirl ribeye paired with the mash potatoes that i smother with the blue cheese butter and the sweet corn pudding and it’s fantastic. You really can’t go wrong. The ribeye is flavorful, mash potatoes are a good creamy texture - paired with the sweet corn pudding this gives the right touch of sweetness in contrast with the savory meat and blue cheese butter. My go to steak place with blue cheese butter. The service is also really good. I’ve never had an issue and i enjoy this place.",

It’s very photogenic and Instagram worthy. \n\nA con is that this is another fancy restaurant that serves a little bit of food for an expensive price. My mom paid $22 for a piece of lasagna that was finished in about 5 bites. \n\nMy sister had spaghetti and meat sauce that was the same portion of the “chef boy are D” spaghetti for about $20 now the worst part.... the waiter recommended me a chicken cutlet and did not tell me the price. I said yes to it. And the price for a chicken cutlet was $38!!! That is way too overpriced. \n\nThe food was good don’t get me wrong, but the prices are crazy. I understand that it is classy place but wow. Prices are too much. \n\nOverall I enjoyed my time here. Service was good",

I had the farfalle and shrimp in a light lemon cream sauce which was excellent. The others had spaghetti squash and salad which were also very good. The starter white pizza with mushrooms was exceptional. The service was very efficient and we were treated royally by the owner! Prices are moderate by NYC standards. Highly recommended.",

When the server came over to the table, we told him we were ready to order and he tried to push \nAlcoholic drinks, and a basket of breakfast muffins. Then we each ordered quite a bit of food and he immediately asked us if we wanted to add sausage, bacon, home fries, and the list went on and on. We politely said no, so he turns to my 14 year old son and asks “ How about some orange juice”? He said sure. ($12 a glass)\nThe food was OK but we felt like tourists being completely pressured and it ruined the meal. \nIronically when we asked for the check, he turns to my son and says “how about some more orange juice”. I just laughed to myself. \nI’m guessing because it’s near all the hotels on Central Park South that perhaps the staff is instructed to pressure the tourists. In addition the restaurant wasn’t very clean.\nNever again.",

Both were good - no complaints there. For my entree, I went with the Mixed Grill Kebab (skewers of chicken, beef and kofta grilled with peppers, mushrooms and onions, served with rice). The chicken looked like it was going to be dry, but it was perfectly cooked. The beef was cooked to a medium rare (perfect for me). The kofta was a bit undercooked, which I didn't notice until I ate a few pieces. But I didn't get sick from it, so that's a good sign. They give a lot of meat, and a good amount of rice. It doesn't come with a salad like the menu said, but it's definitely enough food anyway.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back to try some of their other dishes. Maybe in the spring or summertime, once their outdoor seating is available - since it's right by the water.",

I visit this restaurant during the restaurant week, starting with a happy hour margarita at the bar, very decent considering the price of it.\n\nAs soon as I got to my table, the ambience was so immersive surrounded by the dimmed lights and barrels on the walls. But the true experience came with the food.\n\nComing from a Latino culture, the dishes were mastered to almost perfection. Real Mexican blue corn flautas and queso fundido with chorizo we’re amazing, but the chicken tacos were the star of the show. For dessert, the tres leches cake was stunning and presentation can’t be better.\n\nI will definitely come back to try the other options in the menu, and as I said, you won’t regret to spend a great date here with a club fresh atmosphere.",

As for the atmosphere, this place is crazy busy and kind of cramped. So if you are an anxious person, find another breakfast joint! We literally had a waitress ask us to leave because other guests were waiting, mind you-we had not been sitting at our 2 person table for long but we were waiting for our check so that we COULD leave. It's also a bit pricey for a diner style breakfast (everything was about $17 or more).",

We had the sumo sushi dinner, eel cucumber and eel avocado handroll, mackerel sashimi, and a salmon teriyaki dinner with taro chips. One thing we all agreed that we didn't like was the pork buns. The pork skin was crispy but the meat was overcooked. It was dry and it had too much hoisin sauce. Also, as a cook myself, I would recommend a difference in texture. I would prepare a slice of tender pork belly in order to pair it with the granny smith apple slice. If i were to keep the pork belly crispy, I would recommend some greens or cilantro and julienned cucumbers, perhaps a light flavor mayo. Anyhow, I would go back for the sushi. :)",

We came for a lunch on a Saturday and it was not crowded at all. Food was tasty, I ordered the fillet mignon that was a little over cooked for what I ordered (medium rare). Overall not the best nor the worst experience.\n\nEdit after meal: I understand adding a gratuity to a bill of a party of 8. I don't agree with it being 20%, especially if the service was lack luster.  For this a 3rd star will be removed.",

I would not recommend anyone to go here for food, the food was super bland, no seasoning, and not flavorful at all. We had the enchiladas and it tasted very bad. Also had the \"fried\" Ice cream that was NOT at all fried, just covered in the cornflakes not fried and it tasted bad also just regular icecream, false advertising. I paid for the 3 course meal and I would not recommend it. But the whole atmosphere is great, music was good, the staff is very nice, attentive, and courteous !

Also the choice of music wasn’t good for dancing and there were only few people on the dance floor. It was also impossible to talk, due to loud music. \n\nI recommend it for food, but not for salsa.",

The Russian decor, the Russian service, and live music transported you to a Russian speak easy. The flavored vodka is a must try, we had mango and cucumber, both delightful and refreshing. Then we ordered a beer and white russian, delish! We only had appetizers since we were in a hurry, but made the right choice. We started off with two hot piroshki, one filled with with potato and mushroom and one filled with potato and onion, both exquisite. The warm flaky crust and soft potato center was a great compliment to a cold night. Three smoked fish platter served with warm blini with a dollop of sour cream when rolled up is the best combination of sweet and salty. The service was friendly and helpful. Prices were as expected for midtown Manhattan.",

I was informed I would be notified within 24 hours upon submission. I called the following day to find out how things were going. A very nice hostess informed me that the manager was busy at the moment but would contact me in a few hours. She was nice enough to give me information about the reservation process for large groups. She even took down my name and my number and said he would get back to me! However, with all that be said, I never received a response to my request and it is now going on the 3rd day! Sad because I actually came here for Mother’s Day several years ago. Unfortunate that they treat customers this way!",

It hasn’t been an enjoyable experience at all, I was there last night for Valentine’s Day and I was freezing, I had two drinks and that did not help! I don’t want to go back to this restaurant again! By the time you get all your food on the plate the food is so cold! Not to mention that the staff at the front of the restaurant that are hosting are really disorganized. When I walked in the restaurant yesterday everyone there looked upset, people with reservations were waiting a long time because the restaurant overbooked for the day. I’m hoping this is helpful insight to the people responsible of the success of the restaurant!",

My friend ordered soontofu/spicy tofu soup but asked if it could be made less spicy. The waitress replied that they could. When two orders were brought out, my friend asked which one is the less spicy one, and the waitress pointed it out. \n\nThe first red flag is that both looked red, when normally, they looked orange. After a few minutes of eating, my friend noticed that it was spicy and then tried the other bowl. Again, it was around the same level of spice. So when they called over one of the managers, he said that they do not deviate from the original cooking. So there was a mishap and misrepresentation there. \n\nThe managing waiter tried to remedy it by making it less spicy, where he managed to make the soup look more orange using an egg. It was a nice effort, but the whole thing could have been avoided if the waitress was more upfront with what they could or could not do with the food. \n\nWould have been a 2 stars, but the attempt to remedy brought it up to 3.",

We also got one which was kind of like hash browns instead of rice, not a huge fan but was still ok. Friends loved the croquettes, got two rounds. The octopus was great — one large piece cooked soft and tasty, with a center of mashed potato. Bacon wrapped figs were also yummy.",

They always treat Me like a \"Special Guest\" or Family.\n\nMy Daughter who is a General Manager for a very large restaurant always gets an earful about Balade, because I am always bragging about the Restaurant and inviting Her to come by whenever She comes to New York.\n\nThree years ago,  She surprised Me with a visit to New York City, where She planned a surprise Dinner party with all My Friends at Balade. This was such a Great Evening and Wonderful Birthday Celebration. Everyone enjoyed Themselves Sooooooo Much!\n\nBalade-- What a GREAT RESTAURANT!!!",

The food however is fantastic with menu that changes often but they try to keep stable key dishes (chicken, fish, beef, etc). For starters, the group I was with wanted to share a few items. I had an oyster which was delicious, whipped ricotta served with a cracker (phenomenal) and prosciutto which was basic sliced meat. We also ordered the duck! That was some of the best duck I've ever tasted in.my.life! So tender and the consistency was like ahi tuna. Incredible.\n\nFor my meal I ordered the short rib. The short rib was so juicy and tender and a nice size chunk. When I first looked at the menu and photos, I wasnt to happy because I'm a \"healthy\" guy that likes to eat good size portions. If you play your cards right and order starters, the main dish size will not be an issue.\n\nWith dinner we also had wine. The wine list is pretty extensive so we asked for help choosing one and a gentleman who was very professional and took passion in his work (from what I could tell) asked us what we liked in our wine and he picked one for us. He picked perfectly to our palet.\n\nDessert was also great and we tried multiple items but the devil's food cake with chocolate ice cream was the winner by far. \n\nEnjoy!",

I look forward to attending next year in support of \"ending hunger\" and enjoying a wonderful evening.   Part of the proceeds were donated to ending hunger.  The chefs were amazing and personable.

Reserved ahead of time to get the limited chef's table where you'll be seated close enough to see the chefs in action. As soon as we walked in, already enjoyed the atmosphere and the setup of the restaurant. It was a mix of fancy but also modern casual, loved it. Chef at this time was Paul Liebrandt. We both ordered the tasting menu, a bit pricey but worth the experience! After recommendation, my wife ordered the $24 cocktail called \"The Marathon, nitro frozen drink\". Loved it as we were invited over to the bar to see the making of the drink. I believe the drink is made using some sort of dry ice, pretty cool. Started off with Crab Doughnuts, very tasty. She then got her Kampachi, which I thought was coming out grilles but was actually sashimi. She absolutely loved it, only downside was that there was only 3 pieces haha. Also came out with some sort of soup with Caviar. I'm not a sea food person so I didn't like it but she loved it. I took the veal and hmm...I'm sure it's great, just not my style. Next, she got the Beautiful Cardinal Prawn, also 3 of them, very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, delicious. I had the Sakura Pork and stuffed squid. Both were amazing, loved it. Dessert was the Avocado souffle and the Delice of Grand Gru Chocolate. All very interesting but tasty. Seemed like this Chef has his own mix and match with food because everything we had was different, interesting, and so so unique. Would recommend, make sure you check who's the chef that's there!",

The man taking our order confirmed this and we delivered the meal to my aunt. She asked if there was beef and we told her no, that we confirmed it with the staff when placing the order in. This morning, my aunt sent me a picture to thank me for the food and I saw that there was beef in her meal. She didn't think it would be beef since we had confirmed this with her and thought it was other marinated meat and had eaten it. I really hope that after reading this review the staff of Cho Dang Gol will be more fastidious with their future orders & take restrictions seriously, religious or otherwise. Their carelessness violated my aunt's religious restriction but if this was a food allergy there might've been more grave consequences.",

Chicken was very moist and juicy although I would say a tad lacking in flavour unless you got an extra charred bit. Pulled pork was super tasty and almost verged on sweet which was lovely. The rib is one of the best rib I've had and was a MASSIVE portion... But the brisket stole the show. Was juicy and had a great flavour to it. Two of us had trouble polishing it all off and could of taken some home. The Mac n Cheese was ok as was the biscuit. Drinks/cocktails are a tad on the pricey side but they do taste good. The service was top notch and has a great atmosphere. Would recommend if your coming to times Square it won't disappoint. Only reason it's got 4 out of 5 is those sides and I've had more amazing BBQ but around great place.",

We left so full!!!\n\nNote to others - your party must be fully present to seat you, so my guest waited at the bar which was fine, but then when we wanted to be seated, the hostess assumed we were okay staying at the bar, which is fine, but I'd wished it wasn't presented as \"do you just want to stay at the bar?\" rather maybe, \"we have a table ready for you unless you'd prefer the bar?\" I felt obligated to stay at the bar. Then, when our meal was over, we asked that the Alcohal be put on a separate check than the food but the bar tender said it was our fault he couldn't do that because we didn't tell him earlier on in the night. Well, sorry sir, we didn't know we'd be eating at the bar when we arrived. Also, we were asked NUMEROUS times if we were done with our food, while we were still eating as though they were trying to clear our plates and rush us out.\n\nOverall, great food, we left super full.

      "text": "Soho Park - Prince St. location.\n\nI went to Soho Park for a Saturday brunch with my sister and mother at their Prince St. location.  There’s outside seating along the outside, as well as an area for patio seating. We arrived about 11am, and the place was empty –saved for a couple of diners. The inside ambiance is lovely and bright set against its industrial decor, soften with greenery throughout. \n\nThe brunch menu is not overbearing with options, which is nice. Sometimes too many options on a menu can be bit fussy. My sister and I both got the Traditional American Breakfast, while our mother went for the Buttermilk Pancakes and a vanilla latte. Originally, she wanted the lumberjack but opt for the pancakes when they wanted to charged $7 dollars to substitute the Belgian waffle to pancakes. A bit asinine- I mean they both come from a batter. \n\nI had one issue with my dish when it came out; as I requested my eggs to be over easy it came out just about well done. They redid my eggs, though over easy, it still was over done on the edges. Their home fries were spot on.  Also my dish went back with two pieces of toast and returned with one. The bacon was nice and crispy but that too, I can tell was just a second away from being burnt. They must like cooking on just one level of heat- high heat!  My sister and mother had scrambled eggs; they were happy with it. Where Soho Park fell short with the eggs they made up for it with the buttermilk pancakes. Absolutely delicious!   \n\nThe customer service is lukewarm. As the morning transitioned to midday, more diners started to filter in. I will definitely return to dine here again, as it was a satisfying experience. Love the low key feels, the attractive price point of their dishes, and the straightforwardness of the menu.",

As for the burger, it was very small and over cooked to the point of being exceptionally dry. Based on prices and the burger this place is 2 stars. However the atmosphere is nice. Open air and outdoor on nice days. A reasonable variety for a group.  Basically, if you're out for a day with friends and you want reasonable quality, good selection and good atmosphere, it's the best choice in the area.

However the restaurant was not prepared at all for the influx of these orders. All of the runners were all getting the same options so I'm not sure why it wasn't able to be ready to go or gave large batches (this could just be my ignorance).  We placed an order for pick up and I paid for my meal since my husband ran the marathon and I didn't.  I ordered the other free pasta option because I thought it would be easier that way. \n\nThey told us to come back in thirty minutes for pickup so we went back around forty minutes later. When I got down there it wasn't ready and the bartender (who is over to go) wasn't able to give me an ETA of when the expect it.  \n\nI left and had a drink somewhere else before coming back. We finally got our food and the serving size was not filling at all. My husband and I both agreed even if we had a voucher we wouldn't go back. We ended up getting food somewhere else after. I had better service and a better deal at the 99¢ pizza place across the street.",

Although the music is quite good, it is too loud to my taste. The food is fairly ok. I think they need to revisit their olive oil as it looks like it has the right color the acid level is so high you can choke on it. In any case , a high quality olive oil would never be served in such abundance with a fat big bottle. Service is fast.",

I stopped in one afternoon to try their lunch menu which at $25 is great value compared to other restaurants in NYC. \n\nI sat outside on the small terrace to enjoy the sunny and comfortably warm day, taking in the relaxing atmosphere while I drip my fluffy focaccia in some extra virgin olive oil. Before the food arrived I needed a drink and went with the Sassi Sour made with Four Roses Bourbon, mint, lemon and Lucano Amaro which really added the experience.\n\nA plate of sardines, pork shoulder and beets was a very satisfying start to the lunch menu, as colourful as they were flavourful. For the main I just had to go with the  bavette Cacio e Pepe, one forkful and I was transported back to Rome, the pasta cooked to perfection. To go with this dish I chose the Fellini cocktail made with Giffard apricot liquer, Berta Amaro, lime and prosecco, a sweet balance to the peppery pasta.\n\nFor dessert, I was delighted to have the Lupa Tartufo with its rich chocolaty textures and cool ice cream center was the best ending to my Roman lunch, really look forward to going back!",

The staff are thoughtful, energetic and a wonderful expression of how service can be super buttoned up while remaining casual and informal. The food is nothing short of exceptional with creative seasonal dishes that are both locally sourced but also exquisite. I cannot stress enough why you should be booking a table immediately. I was there last night and I am already making another reservation. I had the soft shell crab (tail end of the season but still fab) and the seafood stew. Also at our table was sea bass, crudo, tartar and of course wine. Previously I had the fish and chips which was awesome. Go go go..why are you still reading!? Make reservation and see for yourself.",

The best dishes of our meal were the octopus appetizer with mozzarella and lemon (an unexpected but totally yummy combination) and the Gruyere cheeseburger, which is rich and made to share. Wait staff was very attentive. There was a super loud group directly behind us and it was slightly annoying to be sat next to them in a mainly empty dining room (we got there very early). I wished for a view of the bridges but we didn't quite get it -- we did get a window seat over the river though. These are small quibbles; overall, we loved it and will be going back to try the Whole Black Sea Bass en Croute with a larger group!",

You cannot even see the boardwalk from the second floor, lending to lofty elegance.  The service is beyond friendly and completely detail oriented, to ensure the best experience.  The bar staff is poised at the ready and concocts the most beautiful cocktails! The food does not disappoint with an amazing raw bar,  including oysters, ceviches and tartars.   Obviously a seafood heavy menu,  there is a to die for burger (and fries!!!) or chicken — for those willing to miss out on these amazingly fresh dishes.  Not to mention a whole Black Sea bass!!  Can’t wait to come back and try the  “simply cooked” menu served with a bean vinaigrette.  The seaport needed a nice restaurant - and here it is with a view!   Save room for dessert xo",

The service was excellent,  the food was great (I'm no foodie, but I love a good steak and this was one of them), and the whole thing really worked. It's in the subterranean vault of the art-deco New Yorker hotel, and you could totally miss it if you didn't know what you were looking for. The period theme is flawlessly carried on I to the restaurant.\n\n The prices are Manhattan steakhouse and the place is not huge.  Being right across the street from Penn Station means it's in a kind of no-man's land, but it's easy to get to.\n\nCool place for a business dinner, will definitely want to go back and check out some post-prohibition cocktails at the bar.",

If you find this recipe helpful, please give a thumbs-up :)\n\nFirst the vibe - interesting mix of vault door and eclectic decorating.  Dim lighting for a more intimate mood pulls it off pretty well.  Note: you have to go into the hotel and take an elevator up to the restaurant.  \n\nThe service was ok, but not up to the standards of other similarly priced places - silverware dropped, reaching in front of diners faces, leaving crumbs all over the table, missed check-in after serving food.  Again, the service didn’t have any major problems, it just didn’t rise to the level of a $400 dinner for two.  \n\nSame with the food.  ‘Not bad’ is the best I can come up with.  Little things the the calamari/shrimp/pepper app not having any shrimp in it (and the waiter insisting we just didn’t see them) to the apple crumble actually being a small apple pie.  The lobster bisque has a great flavor but is extremely salty, while the rest of the food (steak, mac n cheese, etc) was lacking seasoning in general.  The delmonico I had definitely had a smoked flavor but that’s where it stopped.  \n\nPresentation was good and they aren’t being cheap with ingredients or anything ... it’s just that they need some (a lot) of polish for their desired clientele.",

I opted for the grilled  shrimp and scallop in this Thai curry coconut Wonder sauce  over quinoa , with a mint cilantro medley. I also had a delicious jalapeno margarita. I'm still thinking about those lol. For dessert we opted for the mini chocolate fondue. Perfect for two people. My picture is a little dark but you get the idea :-)",

My husband and 2 friends dined here approximately 115 minutes before a show at Madison Square Garden. We made it very clear to our waitstaff that we needed to be out by a certain time to receive our food. Our waiters were clearly very busy and worked hard however the restaurant seems understaffed and the service is unfortunately very slow. It took forever to get our entrees and we felt very rushed to finish before leaving for our show. Sadly, this takes away the entire experience particularly since our food and drink were all delicious.",

Maybe the hype is to get the tourist there, but nothing stood out. Usually 1 of the 3, cheese, sauce or crust would stand out, but average is all I can share about this slice. The service was fine here, but the search will continue for the best slice in NYC.",

You will be hard pressed to get lunch for under $12. The selection is great though! \n\nJust grab your food and go. Take it to Bryant Park. Take it to the steps of the library.

The restaurant is hidden right below the hotel. Inside, the wood and leather theme, combined with greens and natural light, gives a home winter garden feeling. Within such a decor, the quietness of the place creates a privileged and intimate atmosphere. The service is fancy-ish and the food is classic but well executed. While I would not go back for the food alone, I very definitely would for the ambiance. Run there when the busy streets of nyc suddenly feel overwhelming, you’ll feel refreshed!",

The food was just top notch. They prepare salads just as you order so makes a alot of difference. We will return as long as we are in New York in our next business trip.",

Being a native Turk I know how this food should taste like and it was no different then the food in Turkey. \n\nI was happy to meet couple of their servers which were very lovely people and like doing their job with enthusiasm.\n\nThe place isnt so loud either, i enjoyed my time listening to soft turkish music with a little mix of other Mediterranean music they played. Highly recommend making a reservation as i saw them pack up really quickly.",

It is on the loud side...obviously will also depend on other people there because there’s an open room with a bar. \n\nNow the food....fantastic here as well. I came here for the first time during restaurant week. \n\nThe fluke crudo (raw fish) was delicious and not fishy at all. The zucchini and farro was refreshing and substantial. \n\nThe Coq Au Riesling was one of the best chicken dishes I’ve had in my life. We’re all familiar with dry chicken meat and the kind of rib meat that falls right off the bone. Well, this chicken meat was moist and tender. I normally wouldn’t order chicken as an entree at an establishment like this, but it exceeded all expectations!\n\nThe db Burger...there’s a $5 supplement for restaurant week. This burger is substantial..the meat was thicker than the bun. It was perfectly cooked and flavorful. The fries are also good!\n\nBoth the Black Forrest Blombe and Raspberry Gateau were delicious. But I did enjoy the Raspberry Gateau more due to the crunch..the tart..the fresh fruit.\n\nOh! And I forgot to mention...wine pairing for $18!",

We always forget just how big the portions are, pictured was the half portion my wife ordered and had left overs for a few days of. My steak was surprisingly very flavorful.  The wait staff was a little off this time,  but the food was good.",

We also ordered the tiramisu based on a raving review but found it disappointing. The watery rum mixture soaked through the bottom layer and overpowered the rest of the cake, so I scrapped off the soaked mush and only ate the upper part. I peg it to an off day. They gave us prosciutto and bread on the house, a very nice touch. The service was up to par and the place is quiet, allowed you to stay and sit, and not as crowded (we did go at 2). This is indeed a special place in NYC that seem to give customers a excellent portion at a understandable price :)",

When I checked in with the hostess I told her I had a reservation and for some reason instead of asking me who’s birthday we were celebrating she asked my husband and blew the surprise. The food was good by our waiter had the personality of a wet sponge and the speed of a turtle. It took forever to get our food. So after a 2+ hour dining experience we were going to order dessert. Except it took over 20 minutes for the waiter to get around to take our order. At that point we decided to skip dessert and get the check. I got up to use the restroom and to my surprise, while I was gone, the waiter brought over a plate with a couple of cookies and sang happy birthday. He could not wait to do it until I was back at the table??? Just look and see if everyone is there. Now he was in a rush. So I missed out being there with my husband and kids. Not the way I wanted to celebrate his birthday. Was just looking to do something a little special and it blew up. Will not go back again, next time carmines. This is his wife writing the review",

Everything dish was authentic and delicious. The service was attentive and great. The restaurant was crowded and was noisy. The drinks were good and very pricey.

There was no room at the bar so we had no choice but to wait by the door being pushed around by people entering and leaving the restaurant. We had the prix fixed menu and wine pairing for dinner. The food was mediocre at best. The only acceptable (but not actually rememberable) dish was the schnitzel. The cocktail we had prior to dinner was also mediocre and wine pairing was extremely disappointing. They forgot to pour the desert wine so they gave us a shot while we were having our coffee. The shot was so strong and horrible we could not drink it. Unfortunately, the service was also lacking. The few times we tried to ask for water refills and were repeatedly ignored by the waiters when doing so. The whole dinner was almost $600. I have tried a large number of Michelin starred restaurants and was very excited to try Wallse, after this experience I am wondering who decided to give them their star. I have had better dinners and service at way less expensive places. Try something else, this place is not worth it.",

The croquettes were like fluffy crab cake balls..... delicious. The caviar wasn't too fishy and didn't leave a gross taste in your mouth. Very refreshing. The best part was the French toast which was similar to a cinnamon bun topped with apple sauce. It's a great spot with a long tradition.",

Staff doesn't seem to be too friendly and they'll put a number up on the counter that they didn't call which is confusing.\n\nThe interior is really nice and makes you feel like a child because there's so much to look at and potentially buy. We bought tuna salad, herring salad, and a garlic bagel with caviar cream cheese with salmon. The tuna salad has the tuna flavor and is decent. Herring salad tastes pickled and slightly sour and sweet. The caviar cream cheese is just salty cream cheese. The bagel is good, but wasn't breathtaking and I've had better in Toronto. If you're interested, I would recommend it for the experience, but I probably would not come back again.",

The words have gotten out since then, and it is now a super popular spot. \n\nWe didn’t have a reservation, so we decided to get there early. We didn’t have any issue getting a table with just a handful of people at that time. The inside was very cozy. Feeling of an old tavern or a log cabin, filled with animals and antlers on the walls.  \n\nThey had brunch menu and lunch menu, and you can order from both menu during brunch. We ordered Five Cheese Macaroni and Skillet Eggs.  They both came in a small iron skillet. It was smaller than expected, but I always say quality over quantity. They were packed with flavor, comforting, and made really well. \n\nWe had a nice, relaxing, tasty brunch here. The service was polite and nice, we were well taken care of. The menu is a bit on pricey side, but the quality is super high. I have been wanting to try Freemans for quite a long time, I am glad we finally got to dine here! I would like to go back for more, and try some of their cocktails as well in a near future!",

After having gone about 8 hours since our last meal trekking around the city, we wanted to start with an appetizer and take our time to peruse the menu considering it was our first time here. When our food finally did come it wasn’t bad but nothing particularly stood out as great either. The bread to start was cold, as if it has just come out of the refrigerator cold. The meatballs were just okay. The squash pasta was a bit cold and chalky and not much flavor. And the burger was tiny, almost a slider size.

The service was very odd and sporadic. The whole flow of the meal was made awkward by our server forgetting to bring plates for the appetizer and then directing us to hold up our appetizer plates while he placed our main course. When we asked for an additional condiment, we were told it wasn’t available, though the server backtracked when we pointed out that this condiment was a menu item.  While the food was good, I was really disappointed by this meal. Upon first entering the restaurant, we were treated as if we were a burden. I recommend going elsewhere to spend your hard earned dollars. The National isn’t interested in earning them.",

I called the Resturant and spoke to  who I believe his name is Mike , for him to tell me that the store does not offer refunds, but he can make me 3 new burgers . I explained to him that I am in a different borough now and can not make my way back there . He then Again replied saying there nothing he can do .

We made reservations and thankfully didn’t seem like we needed them as  there was no wait and we were seated earlier than the reservation time. The waiter Brandon was delightful. He was energetic, friendly and made the perfect recommendations. For drinks we tried the peach Moscow mule nice and strong and we tried a chocolate pretzel drink which sounded weird and gross but when we tried it it was delicious. The drinks were not weak at all.  We got calamari as an appetizer the calamari were small but the three sauces that came with it were tasty. They were all spicy which was a plus for me but not for my wife who can’t have spicy foods. I wanted the famous burger lobster combo but Brandon told me that specialized menu would not last and I can always come back for the burger and the lobster. I went with his advice and ordered the shrimp and lobster ravioli which he said took the chef 6 month to prepare - it was delicious. I was worried the portion size would be skimpy but it was perfect and there was plenty of lobster in and out of the ravioli. Thankfully my wife ordered the burger and lobster and I got to try it OMGEEEE the French fries were perfect and that butter garlic sauce was so good I wanted to put it on everything.  I have not one complaint about this place. The food, the ambience and the service were all top notch!  Will definitely be coming here again.",

We were greeted immediately by the waiter and he did a good job of taking care of us throughout the meal. I went with the beast burger so I could get some lobster and a burger. I've never had lobster on a burger, but I actually was very impressed with it. It gave it an interesting flavor and the beef was very juicy. The fries were good as well as the salad. I would happily eat here again if I was in the area.",

First it was more a pork sandwich it had to much pork and just one slice of ham and one slice of cheese the three sandwiches was the same preparation. Over priced one beer, two sodas over $100. dollars I asked the waiter if the Chef was Cuban, not at all he was Mexican, the owner Jewish. I don't understand why is so difficult to find true Cuban, food prepared by their own people that knows the secret of an original plate preparation. First and last visit.",

The Benedict came with a lot of food. The potatoes were the best part! Super flavorful. The hollandaise sauce on top of the Benedict was too thick for my taste. The small bunch of greens on the side was nice to break the meal up. My husband had no complaints with his omelette.

Today I tried a pasta dish - cheese ravioli - and very much enjoyed it. I also had a salad and a very tasty house-made sangria and was offered a basket of garlic bread (total around $38). This will definitely be on our short list in the theater district ahead of some other places that may have bigger reputations but have proved underwhelming.",

This place makes you feel like you're a regular.  See if you can get a good rate at the Belvedere, and you will have a very nice and almost private stay on a quiet street just a few yards away from crazy Times Square and the theater district (which is what I went for)  It makes a perfect getaway for one or two theater lovers who also love Italian food and don't want to go to the chain places.",

They were constantly asking if we wanted water or what kind of water even if we told them. Feel like all the waiters were asking us and didn't even care to communicate with each other. Our pastas came out first.  They did not give us the bread and vegies that were suppose to come out before. so I had to ask for them. \nI didn't have good service last time and taught that it was from the busy hours but now I know that it was not. hope they improve on this",

However, the best part is the FOOD. Everything is seasoned well and cooked very well whenever I visit. They always refill my water as soon as possible which I love and always ask if I need anything else. I always get the chicken or pork curry and it's really good!! I always think about this place whenever I'm on fifth ave. It's definitely a great place to eat. Beware of the place closing at 3:15pm and reopening at 5pm! \nGo eat and enjoy enjoy enjoy~",

Once there, if you do the waitlist the wait isn't more than 20 to 30 min.  It's an entertaining wait because you see how many people order take out or delivery from this place.  Sitting there waiting, thinking -it's got to be good if this many people want it to go too!   If you peek around the corner and there are seats at the bar, you can sit there without the wait.  I can't even tell you the name of anything that the 3 of us ordered but we were all so so happy with what we ordered.  They even brought us a sample shot of yellow squash soup - loved that!  Portions were large and truly great.  I don't recommend huge party size here but up to 6 people would not be a challenge.   This is a must go to place!",

My steak was excellent, but my wife's salmon was a bit over cooked. The nachos were also very good. Would eat there again",
